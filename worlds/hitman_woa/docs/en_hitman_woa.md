# HITMAN Worlds of Assassination

## What is considered a location check in HITMAN?

The Completion of each Level, as well as the completion of each Level with a rating of "Silent Assassin", "Suit Only" and "Silent Assassin, Suit Only" can each be configured to give a check. "Itemsanity" can be enabled to give one check for each different Item picked up while ingame. Only Items that go into the inventory and can be dropped give checks (i.e. Crowbar, Screwdriver), items like keys and collectable information do not.

## What HITMAN items can appear in other players' worlds?

Every level needs to be unlocked by collecting a corresponding item. Any item that can be equipped in the planning screen of a mission is randomised away. This includes all Weapons, Gear, Starting Locations (except the first one in each mission), Agency Pickup Locations (except the first one in each Hitman 1 mission) and Suits.
